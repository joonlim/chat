bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- When user who logs out tries to log back in, the server thinks they are still logged in
	-RESOLVED

- client sends JOINP with wrong password, his fd is not listend for anymore.

- same issue if client attempts to join a PUBLIC room using JOINP.

- server shouldn't tell user who just connected that they conencted.
	-Dont see that - assume resolved.

- better error message for bad password creation

- error code // 41   INVALID USER unused?

- If user tries to login with account that doesn't eixst, should give error     line 513 server.c

- remove print statements 
	-"Is making new user? 0"

- make sure password creation is good
	-seems good

TODO:
-null terminate hash

-seg fault when user disconnects


when room name is many words, id is the second word, not the last number
	e.g
	my room 1
		id of room
	my 1
		id of 1

sometimes listrooms command crashes 

when a bad password is entered to regiester user, client just hangs
